# Antimony Project (GEMINI.md)

This document provides a summary of the Antimony project, generated by Gemini.

## Project Overview

Antimony is a personal C++ project containing a collection of libraries and utilities. The project is built using CMake and provides functionalities for:

*   **Database Access:** A Data Access Object (DAO) pattern implementation for database interaction.
*   **Event System:** A notifier and listener system for event-driven programming.
*   **Logging:** A flexible and configurable logging framework.
*   **Custom Types:** Utility types like `Singleton` and compile-time `StringLiteral`.

## Directory Structure

*   `src/`: Contains the source code for the libraries.
*   `include/`: Contains the header files for the libraries.
*   `examples/`: Contains example applications demonstrating the usage of the libraries.
*   `cmake/`: Contains CMake helper scripts.
*   `scripts/`: Contains utility scripts, including the build script.

## Building the Project

The project can be built using the `build.sh` script in the `scripts/` directory.

### Build Libraries

To build the main libraries, run:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

### Build Examples

To build all example applications:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh -es
```

To build a specific example (e.g., `DatabaseApp`):

```bash
./scripts/build.sh -e DatabaseApp
```

## Library Components

### Database (`database/`)

The `database` library provides a `TagDaoImpl` class that implements a DAO pattern for a `TagDaoObj`. It supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Event (`event/`)

The `event` library provides a simple notifier/listener mechanism. You can add and remove listeners and notify them with arguments.

### Logger (`logger/`)

The `logger` library provides a `Logger` class for logging messages with different levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error). It can be configured with different outputs and timing formats.

### Types (`types/`)

The `types` library includes helper classes:

*   `Singleton`: A template class for creating singleton objects.
*   `StringLiteral`: A utility for creating compile-time string literals.
