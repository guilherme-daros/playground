# Antimony Project (GEMINI.md)

This document provides a summary of the Antimony project, generated by Gemini.

## Project Overview

Antimony is a personal C++ project containing a collection of libraries and utilities. The project is built using CMake and provides functionalities for:

*   **Database Access:** A Data Access Object (DAO) pattern implementation for database interaction.
*   **Event System:** A notifier and listener system for event-driven programming.
*   **Logging:** A flexible and configurable logging framework.
*   **Custom Types:** Utility types like `Singleton` and compile-time `StringLiteral`.

## Directory Structure

*   `src/`: Contains the source code for the libraries.
*   `include/`: Contains the header files for the libraries.
*   `examples/`: Contains example applications demonstrating the usage of the libraries.
*   `cmake/`: Contains CMake helper scripts.
*   `scripts/`: Contains utility scripts, including the build script.

## Building the Project

The project can be built using the `build.sh` script in the `scripts/` directory.

### Build Libraries

To build the main libraries, run:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

### Build Examples

To build all example applications:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh -es
```

To build a specific example (e.g., `DatabaseApp`):

```bash
./scripts/build.sh -e DatabaseApp
```

The available example applications are: `ConfigApp`, `DatabaseApp`, `FilteringApp`, `NotifierApp`, `SingletonApp`, `StringLiteralApp`, and `ThreadSafeApp`.

## Library Components

### Database (`database/`)

The `database` library provides `TagDAO` and `TagDTO` classes. `TagDAO` implements a DAO pattern for `TagDTO` objects, supporting basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a `tags` table with `tag` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY) and `tag_type` (INTEGER) columns. The library also includes:
*   `Handler`: Manages SQLite database connections and ensures thread-safe access.
*   `Interface`: A templated base class defining the common DAO operations.
*   `Types`: Defines utility types like `Buffer` for database operations.

### Event (`event/`)

The `event` library provides a simple notifier/listener mechanism. You can add and remove listeners and notify them with arguments.

### Logger (`logger/`)

The `logger` library provides a `Logger` class for logging messages with different levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error). It can be configured with different outputs and timing formats.

### Types (`types/`)

The `types` library includes helper classes:

*   `Singleton`: A template class for creating singleton objects.
*   `StringLiteral`: A utility for creating compile-time string literals.
